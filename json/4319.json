As he slowly gained a little confidence he started becoming very reactive to any people or dogs we would run into while walking him in the neighborhood. He would bark and lunge at anyone as soon as he saw them, even breaking off of a leash one time. It got so bad that we were scared to walk him any place that he might see something and get spooked. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a particularly bad experience walking him (and being left unsatisfied with our first trainer) I called around and got phone consultations from just about every local dog trainer I could find. After talking to Carla and seeing what she has to offer she was the clear choice. She lives and breaths dogs and has a deep understanding of what makes them tick. Not to mention, for the same average price of JUST private training with other trainers, you get private training, group training, and all training equipment included with Carla! The value she provides simply blows everyone else out of the water. I at first thought the group lessons would be something extra that was just kind of tacked on, but they have proved invaluable for helping my reactive dog practice being calm around triggers in a safe and controlled environment. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A month ago when I called Carla I never would have believed that my dog would be as well behaved as he is now (of course, your timeline may vary, every dog is different). Carla is great at figuring out ways to incorporate training into your dogs daily routine so that it doesn&#8217;t end up taking a bunch of extra time on your end to get results. She equipped me with the knowledge and tools I needed to have the confidence to walk my dog through my busy neighborhood with no fear for his safety or my own. As you can imagine with a trainer as good as Carla and the value that she offers, spots are limited! So if you are having any issues with your dog, don&#8217;t wait. Give her a call today!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/contrib\/111727696183076505421\/reviews?hl=en-US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Kent Berry<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Carla has the knowledge, resources, value, and flexibility of some of the larger dog-training institutions, while still maintaining the more personal touch of a small business.
