It&#8217;s best to be proactive and set up your puppy for success! We&#8217;ll also cover the key obedience commands you can use to communicate with your dog every day: sit, down, come, stay, leave it, place and walking on a loose leash.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only will we make sure your dog has excellent house manners and listens to you even around distractions, we\u2019ll also make sure your dog listens when they don\u2019t have a leash on\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which is awesome because most family dogs spend 99% of the time off-leash at home. You\u2019ll be able to get them to listen without having to physically be near them.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We teach offleash skills in a Monday-Friday training camp once your pup is 6 months or older. This way your pup can progress quickly with a professional trainer, and you won&#8217;t have to spend too much time away from your dog. Your dog will stay overnight from Monday until Friday, when you&#8217;ll pick him or her up and have a lesson covering new skills. When you drop off your dog on the next Monday, we&#8217;ll pick up training and focus on any areas you may have struggled with over the weekend.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The capstone is the AKC Canine Good Citizen test. When you feel ready as a team, you have the opportunity to test your obedience skills around other dogs and people and earn your first AKC title together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our Perfect Puppy Training Program also comes with a LIFETIME support guarantee so you never have to worry about your dog\u2019s training slipping over time. You and your dog can always come by for a refresher lesson, free of charge, whether you need help or you just want help teaching your dog cool tricks (maybe even earn some Trick Dog titles with the AKC!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-4 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:66.66%\">\n<p>This program includes:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>6 puppy training lessons<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>10 days of overnight training camp at our facility (split over 2 weeks, with your dog coming home to you on weekends)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Lifetime invitation to join group polishing classes to practice around other trained dogs&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>AKC Canine Good Citizen test<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Lifetime Support via live private lessons and access to the private client Facebook group<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>All training equipment included<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Skills covered:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Manners like waiting at doors, not jumping on people or stealing food off counters, crate training, staying calm when asked and more<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Listening around the house AND in public off-leash, and around heavy distractions<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Teaches leave it, drop it, come when called offleash, walking without pulling, sit, down, stay, place (stay on their bed).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:33.33%\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-layout-flex wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link wp-element-button\" href=\"https:\/\/calendly.com\/fluentdogtraining\/free-phone-consultation-ga\">Pick a time to tell us all about your puppy!<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<!-- Calendly inline widget begin -->\n<div class=\"calendly-inline-widget\" data-url=\"https:\/\/calendly.com\/fluentdogtraining\/free-phone-consultation-ga?hide_event_type_details=1&amp;hide_gdpr_banner=1\" style=\"min-width:320px;height:630px;\"><\/div>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"https:\/\/assets.calendly.com\/assets\/external\/widget.js\" async=\"\"><\/script>\n<!-- Calendly inline widget end -->\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Our puppy programs begin at $725. <\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our puppy programs are for dogs 5 months and younger.
