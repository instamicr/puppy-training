His owners were very stressed about going out of town. How could someone else take care of their dog without being bitten?<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignleft size-full\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"480\" height=\"640\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/fluentdogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/aggressive-chihuahua-small-dog.jpg?resize=480%2C640\" alt=\"aggressive long hair chihuahua\" class=\"wp-image-3639\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/fluentdogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/aggressive-chihuahua-small-dog.jpg?w=480&amp;ssl=1 480w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/fluentdogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/aggressive-chihuahua-small-dog.jpg?resize=300%2C400&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/fluentdogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/aggressive-chihuahua-small-dog.jpg?resize=150%2C200&amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>They had already completed a basic puppy class using positive reinforcement only, so Loki has an excellent foundation in obedience commands like sit, touch, and coming when called. However, he would not do these commands amid distractions and he would often hide under the bed and not come out.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;At FluentDog, our goal is to create dogs who do their commands happily, with motivation,<strong> but also with reliability<\/strong>. There must be good consequences for good behaviors and bad consequences for bad behaviors.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Loki\u2019s case, unintentional positive reinforcement led to him becoming an aggressive dog. This happens quite frequently. At some point Loki felt uncomfortable enough to growl and bite. After all, he lives in a world of terrifying giants, 20-30 times his size, who often invade his space. When he bit, the \u201cthreat\u201d (someone getting in his space ) went away. Who wants to stay near a biting dog? Now, Loki felt better\u2013the \u201cthreat\u201d went away because of his aggressive behavior. Dogs just do what they feel is in their best interest. Aggression worked for him to feel more safe\u2013and so the aggressive behavior got stronger.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the severity of his bites, if he was a larger dog, we would be having a very different conversation in terms of Loki\u2019s future. He was biting HARD. However, we decided to take him on. Even little dogs deserve an education.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We taught Loki to tolerate and even like wearing a muzzle so we could work with him safely\u2013and so his aggressive behavior would no longer result in people retreating from him. It no longer had the desired effect.&nbsp; We also implemented more rules and structure in the house and so it was easier for Loki to make the right choices. Just these little things made a big difference.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Teaching a small dog to enjoy wearing a muzzle\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/k7WTI3LctyA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We also taught Loki how to heel nicely, walking on leash without pulling. It may not seem like a big deal to have a 5-pound dog that pulls, but it really impacts the dog\u2019s state of mind and ability to follow a leader. Remember, even a 5-pound dog is still a dog. Treating them like little babies in fur coats does them a huge disservice because their biological needs are not being fulfilled.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Loki\u2019s owners were so happy with his progress in private lessons that they upgraded to a board-and-train program where we introduced offleash obedience to bring the reliability of his commands to an even higher level. Every day, we post videos of the dogs currently in training to our private Facebook group so owners can follow along and learn what their dogs are learning. Now his owners could enforce the commands that Loki knew and enjoyed doing. Motivation AND reliability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently I taught Loki\u2019s owners how to trim his tiny little nails safely, and groom him, using the stairs in their house as a sort of grooming pedestal. Training dogs of extreme sizes forces you to be creative!\u00a0I was very happy to hear that he recently stayed with one of their family members successfully while his owners went out of town.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you have a small dog with aggression or problem behaviors like excessive barking or pulling on leash? At FluentDog, we have a strong understanding of why dogs do the things they do\u2013and we can help you get the control you need.
