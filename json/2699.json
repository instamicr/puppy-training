It was fascinating to see the training process of the same breed&#8211;but at different ages and different training goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Scotty the  Doberman from Montgomery Village<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Scotty was a 5 year old adult red and rust male Doberman with natural ears.

Scotty also jumped on people, destroyed things in the house and nipped (in play, but still scary for people who didn\u2019t know him!). Basically, Scotty\u2019s owner needed help getting his powerful 90-lb dog to learn how to listen more reliably and be less of a bull in a china shop.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>\u201c Scotty was kicked out of his original school with his first trainer due to his behavioral issues.&nbsp; Carla took him on without hesitation and immediately made me feel comfortable that we would have success.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I found Scotty to be a goofy, silly Lab in a scary Doberman\u2019s body. He was extremely friendly with people, just overexuberantly so! In follow-up lessons after the jumpstart, his owner and I have worked together on how to implement structure in the house and on walks to improve his behavior.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scotty was used to wearing a prong collar, which is a very useful training tool, but he had learned to just pull through it when he was overexcited. So I introduced Scotty to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.k9lifelinestore.com\/product\/k9-lifeline-transitional-leash\/\">K9 Lifeline transitional leash<\/a>, one of my favorite tools for helping overexcited dogs to be more calm. Learning to have something on his nose also helped to acclimate Scotty to a muzzle. Scotty had some incidents of leash reactivity and we did not want this to ever escalate to a bite, so a muzzle was an important safety tool.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now Scotty is well on his way to being an obedient companion, without losing his zest for life! Here\u2019s what his owner had to say:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>\u201cAfter consistently having negative experiences walking and at the house with guests we are having more relaxed walks and the guests are not harassed like they were in the past.&nbsp; He is much more patient and waits to be invited into your space, huge difference. \u201c<\/p><\/blockquote><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out Scotty\u2019s training playlist!

His owner came all the way from Virginia to get his pup started on the right paw in life. (For our out-of-town clients, we can adapt our programs&#8211; just ask!) Titan came to us with all the typical exuberance and challenges of a young working breed dog. He had a lot of drive and enthusiasm&#8211;perfect for dog sports, but challenging in a busy family home. Titan was teething, and when frustrated or over-tired, he was quite nippy and jumpy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1365\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/fluentdogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/DobermanPuppyCroppedEars-1024x1365.jpg?resize=1024%2C1365&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2703\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/fluentdogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/DobermanPuppyCroppedEars-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C1365&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/fluentdogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/DobermanPuppyCroppedEars-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C400&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/fluentdogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/DobermanPuppyCroppedEars-scaled.jpg?resize=150%2C200&amp;ssl=1 150w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/fluentdogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/DobermanPuppyCroppedEars-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/fluentdogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/DobermanPuppyCroppedEars-scaled.jpg?resize=1152%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1152w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/fluentdogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/DobermanPuppyCroppedEars-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C2048&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/fluentdogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/DobermanPuppyCroppedEars-scaled.jpg?resize=350%2C467&amp;ssl=1 350w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/fluentdogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/DobermanPuppyCroppedEars-scaled.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Puppies need at least 18 hours of sleep per day! A tired puppy, like a tired, fussy baby, will exhibit problem behaviors much more than a well-rested one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ll notice that Titan\u2019s ears are cropped, as is traditional for the breed. In order for a Doberman\u2019s ears to stand up as an adult, they must be trained to do so from puppyhood so the cartilage forms properly. In this stage, a cylindrical piece of foam is taped to the ears with medical tape and replaced as necessary. Cropping ears and docking tails are optional procedures that do not harm the dog!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We worked with Titan to instill a strong foundation using positive reinforcement and structure. A puppy should always be crated or on leash so that they are not able to practice unwanted behaviors, and so they get lots of positive reinforcement for correct behaviors. It is much easier to prevent unwanted behaviors than it is to address them once they have become a problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enjoy some extreme puppy cuteness in Titan\u2019s videos!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Titan&#039;s Training Playlist\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/videoseries?list=PL-56as4GL3F2nKqWv5aPVPIqAZg0CIuxq\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We can\u2019t wait to see how Titan grows up, and to support his owners through the stages of Doberman puppy development!
