We prepare breakfast for the dogs (we accept up to 8 at a time). Boarding dogs eat 2-3 meals per day and training dogs earn their meals throughout the day as part of their training.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>8-10am: group socialization and training sessions<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>10am-12pm: rest in crate or other exercises to promote calmness during \u201cdown time\u201d in the home<gwmw style=\"display:none;\"><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>12-1:00pm: lunch for humans (and some dogs)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>1:00-3pm: Training sessions and walks<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>(We can teach dogs to walk on the treadmill if it\u2019s too hot or cold for a long walk outside!)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>3-5pm: Rest time for dogs, office time for humans. This is important \u201csoak time\u201d for them to process what they\u2019ve just learned!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>5pm: Dinner for dogs and time off for humans<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>10pm: Last call for potty and good night!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are new to dog training, a board and train makes the learning curve easier when you get home, because the dog already has some knowledge of the commands, and we will teach you how to maintain them for life. Board and trains cost more than private lessons because you are paying for me to treat your dog like my own\u20133+ walks a day, and several short training sessions per day. I also video my training sessions and provide frequent updates to owners via the private client Facebook group.<gwmw style=\"display:none;\"><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Board and trains are great if you need to board your dog while you go on vacation, and you want her to learn some obedience skills while at training camp!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it\u2019s important to have realistic expectations. Board and trains are not a magic pill. If you don\u2019t maintain the training at home, neither will your dog. Some severe behavior issues (particularly anxiety, reactivity and aggression) take time, and are measured in \u201cimprovement\u201d rather than \u201ccured\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s why we offer generous follow-up support, such as weekly group lessons and private lessons included in your board-and-train program. We give you all the knowledge and resources you\u2019ll need to get your dog to behave just as well for you as for the trainer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interested in doing a Board and Train? <a href=\"https:\/\/calendly.com\/fluentdogtraining\/free-phone-consultation-ga?month=2023-01\">Schedule a call<\/a> to learn more about what is included in FluentDog training packages.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Why Choose a Board and Train at FluentDog?
