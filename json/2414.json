Carla was extremely patient, so knowledgeable and went above and beyond to provide us with videos, her own experiences, training materials (even dropping off leashes and treats for training exercises!) and really quelled our anxieties. &#8211; Nick C.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ongoing support for peace of mind<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/fluentdogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/IMG_2300-2.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>She was punctual, had excellent work quality, professional, very responsive and her board and train is excellent value for money. My dog Niko took to her instantly and she was excellent with him. I was kind of lost in how to achieve the behavior I wanted in my dog but Carla always knew exactly what to do. She was very knowledgeable. She picked up dropped off which was great and she sent me pictures and videos everyday. One of the really awesome things about Carla was that she continued to support me even after Niko was done with his training! I was very happy with my experience with her and I highly recommend her!<br>&#8211; Kaylia B.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>NOTE: Niko came to FluentDog with the main goal of reducing his barking at the door.

Let me say this, we are glad that we did! We sent Riley for two weeks with her and he returned as if he never committed his old behaviors! He now follows directions on cue and relaxes when it&#8217;s time to.
