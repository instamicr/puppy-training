And you can\u2019t address unwanted behavior if you\u2019re not there. So that\u2019s why we use the crate as a babysitter when we are not able to have eyes on the dog.<\/p>\n<cite>Carla<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>If your dog is barking at things outside, it is important to figure out the reason why they are barking. Once you know the reason, you can take steps to address it. For example, if your dog is barking because they are bored, you can give them more toys and chew bones to keep them occupied. If your dog is barking because they are excited, you can try to desensitize them to the things that are making them excited. And if your dog is barking because they are afraid, you can help them to overcome their fear through <a href=\"https:\/\/fluentdogs.com\/dog-training\">dog training<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some of the reasons why dogs bark at things outside:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Guarding and protection: Dogs are pack animals and have a natural instinct to protect their pack, which includes their humans. When they see something they perceive as a threat, they will bark to warn their pack and try to scare the threat away.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Boredom: Dogs are social animals and need mental and physical stimulation. If they are bored, they may bark as a way to entertain themselves.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Excitement: Dogs are also very excitable animals. When they see something they are excited about, they may bark to express their excitement.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Attention-seeking: Dogs are also very good at getting attention from their humans. If they want attention, they may bark to get their humans to come and see what is going on.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fear: Some dogs may bark at things outside because they are afraid of them. This is especially common in dogs that have had negative experiences with the outside world, such as being attacked by another animal or being abused by a human.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It is also important to remember that barking is a normal behavior for dogs. It is how they communicate with their humans and with the world around them. However, if your dog is barking excessively, it can be a nuisance to you and your neighbors. If your dog is barking excessively, it is important to seek professional help from a <a href=\"https:\/\/fluentdogs.com\/dog-training\">dog trainer or behaviorist<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Every time your dog practices an unwanted behavior, it gets stronger.
