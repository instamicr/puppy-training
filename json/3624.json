Whether it\u2019s stopping barking at other dogs, house guests, or squirrels out the window, what most owners don\u2019t realize is that stopping barking should actually not be the end goal. Huh? Barking is a SYMPTOM, not usually the true underlying problem. So the first thing I ask is: well, when do you notice your dog barking? If possible I prefer to solve the underlying issue rather than chasing symptoms.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Teaching a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_EdCPhfdeNs\">\u201cQuiet\u201d command is pretty easy<\/a>, especially if you have a barky dog. But if you can\u2019t get your dog to stop barking at triggers in the first place, the usefulness of that command is somewhat limited. Dogs usually bark out of overarousal\/frustration. It\u2019s as if they are saying, \u201cHey! Let\u2019s do something fun! Stop being boring!\u201d or \u201cI REALLY WANT TO CHASE THAT SQUIRREL BUT I CAN\u2019T!!\u201d They are reacting before thinking. Everyone, people included, reacts before thinking sometimes but it should not be the default.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/fluentdogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Teaching-dogs-to-stop-barking.jpg?resize=640%2C480&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3626\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/fluentdogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Teaching-dogs-to-stop-barking.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/fluentdogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Teaching-dogs-to-stop-barking.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/fluentdogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Teaching-dogs-to-stop-barking.jpg?resize=150%2C113&amp;ssl=1 150w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/fluentdogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Teaching-dogs-to-stop-barking.jpg?resize=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Socks (on the treadmill), Layla (German Shepherd) and Ollie are all reformed loud dogs<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Would you believe each one of these 3 dogs came to FluentDog Training because they would not stop barking at people and\/or dogs? Now, as you can see, they are not barking and they are truly relaxed around each other. My \u201cprescription\u201d or behavior modification plan for each of these three barky dogs was a little different for each one.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first time I met Ollie the doodle he would not stop barking for nearly the entire lesson. His owners and I had to shout to communicate! He barks when he\u2019s happy, kind of a \u201cWoohoo! Let\u2019s get this party started!\u201d His real issue is that he did not know how to calm down when he got excited. He cranked the volume to 11 and would party on. However, now his owners can get him to calm down when they tell him to. And that\u2019s not just about telling the dog a sit or a down command\u2013it\u2019s about teaching the dog to relax and be calm in a sit or a down.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Socks was reactive to life in general. His skin reacted to the slightest allergen, his stomach reacted to various ingredients and of course he lunged, shrieked and barked at anyone and anything he saw on walks. So step #1 for Socks was to get&nbsp; him physically healthy. If you don\u2019t feel well, you won\u2019t act very well either. NThen we went on to the typical program of teaching him how to walk nicely on a leash amid various distractions. He is still a work in progress but as you can see he is able to relax around other dogs without barking at them now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Layla\u2019s issue was simply that she is a working breed, and if you don\u2019t give a working dog a job, she will invent her own! Layla had decided her job was to keep other dogs away from her family by barking aggressively. Very typical for a German Shepherd, but once she learned that her job was to heel nicely on walks, the barking went away. She was just waiting for someone to lead her, rather than feeling like she had to make the decisions. Now she is thriving thanks to clear communication and expectations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The common factor of all three dogs is that they had NO chill. They didn\u2019t know how to just \u201cbe\u201d. So that\u2019s why we teach every single dog at FluentDog how to RELAX! Once you find the underlying issue, the way to stop barking becomes apparent.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are experts in stopping barking because we know how to read dogs well.
