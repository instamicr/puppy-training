Aggression or resource guarding in a Golden Retriever is absolutely not in keeping with the breed standard, but it is becoming more common to see, as the \u201cEnglish Cream\u201d (a backyard breeder term) Golden Retrievers are so popular. Unscrupulous breeders are breeding for quantity, not quality. Some even cross Goldens with Great Pyrenees (a breed that is SUPPOSED to aggressively guard its territory) to get that fluffy white coat. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/images.akc.org\/pdf\/breeds\/standards\/GoldenRetriever.pdf\">According to the AKC,<\/a> a Golden Retriever\u2019s temperament should be: \u201cFriendly, reliable, and trustworthy. Quarrelsomeness or hostility towards other dogs or people in normal situations, or an unwarranted show of timidity or nervousness, is not in keeping with Golden Retriever character.\u201c<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I suspect that Charlie may have come from a less-than-ethical breeder. Puppy mills can be extremely marketing-savvy and I get so many clients who don\u2019t even realize they bought from a puppy mill agent. They pick up the puppy from a farm and are not allowed to see the parents or other littermates&#8230;because they aren&#8217;t there! <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Buying a puppy is not an online transaction (anyone can say anything online) and you do need to do some legwork, talk to actual people, and see actual relatives of the puppy you are considering. <a href=\"https:\/\/wagwalking.com\/wellness\/find-reputable-breeder-checklist\">Here is a great checklist to vet any potential dog breeder.<\/a>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also recommend buying from a breeder who titles their dogs in a sport (conformation, obedience, agility, dock diving, even Canine Good Citizen). Yes, this is important even if you just want a pet, not a show dog! Titles are third-party proof that the breeder\u2019s dogs can do what the breeder says they can do and that their dogs are trainable to an objective standard.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, back to Charlie and his odd resource guarding. To some degree, it is normal for a puppy to protest when you take something they want. If this happens to you, the safest thing to do is take the dog away from the item (not the item away from the dog) or ideally teach your dog &#8220;drop it&#8221; long before you ever need to use it. I would never punish a dog for growling because that is communication. Better to growl rather than have a dog bite \u201cout of nowhere\u201d because the dog was punished for growling in the past. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, at 4 months old, nippiness could be related to teething or just not knowing how to \u201cdrop it\u201d&nbsp; or \u201cleave it\u201d on cue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once I taught Charlie how to let go of items as part of a fun game, the issue went away. His problem was just being a baby and not knowing yet. Soon, he did not see people as a threat to \u201chis stuff\u201d. In fact, people brought him good things and might even play with the items he had!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Charlie day 1\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/1UDjkfN35gU?list=PL-56as4GL3F0WjPSTKmb03rWtCtNK20p5\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>At the time Charlie stayed with me, I made Youtube playlists for each dog! Now I share daily videos in our client Facebook group so all can learn.<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I did see that Charlie was a bit of an oddball in his play style\u2013overall, his body language was happy, wiggly and totally normal for a puppy. Yet he still growled when he played. After observing him for 2 weeks, I concluded this was just a quirk of his personality, not something to be overly concerned about. It was weird, but not true aggression. It is important to look at the dog\u2019s body language OVERALL and not be overly focused on one aspect, like a wagging tail (often associated with a happy dog, but a biting dog can also be wagging its tail) or ears down (can a sign of submission or fear, but some dogs do this when they are happy).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ever since training, Charlie has been a trustworthy and valued member of his family. They have not seen any more resource guarding and he happily drops any item. He is good on walks and they take him to their kids\u2019 sports events all the time. He is just exactly what you would expect of a Golden Retriever. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also learned patience! This is what his owner texted me the morning after he came home:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cCharlie was quiet until 7 today when my son got up!&nbsp; And he stayed in place for 10-15 min while my son ate his bagel on the coach. Wow wow. I was so impressed.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"664\" height=\"902\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/fluentdogs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/charlie-adult-golden-retriever.jpg?resize=664%2C902&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Charlie, now an adult Golden Retriever, poses with Carla LaFleur the trainer.
