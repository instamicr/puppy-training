But does it really work?<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As humans we understand that \u201cNo\u201d means \u201cStop whatever you\u2019re doing\u201d but your dog does not naturally understand that abstraction. To us, it\u2019s obvious&#8211; we want that word \u201cNo\u201d to mean:&nbsp; sit instead of jumping on Grandma, come instead of chasing the cat, AND  leave the food that dropped on the floor.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of these are different behaviors in your dog\u2019s eyes. If you want better communication with your dog and more obedient behavior,&nbsp; teach him what TO do instead of what NOT to do. It is amazing how many behavior problems go away once dogs understand what is expected of them!<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Instead of saying \u201cNo\u201d once things have already gone wrong\u2026be proactive!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Teach your dog to sit when he greets people.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Teach your dog to come when called, even amid really tempting distractions like cats and squirrels.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Teach your dog \u201cleave it\u201d if something tasty drops on the floor.<br><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, there is nothing wrong with correcting a known behavior. For example, say you are walking your dog. You&#8217;re about to cross the street but you need to wait for the traffic signal to change. &#8220;Sit,&#8221; you say to your dog&#8230;but he\u2019s daydreaming about Lacey the Labradoodle across the street. Even though you\u2019ve taught him \u201csit\u201d and practiced it hundreds of times, he\u2019s not doing it. In this scenario, it is completely fair and appropriate to say \u201cNo\u201d and use pressure on the leash or a hand pushing down on his rump to enforce the sit.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The word \u201cNo\u201d in this scenario has a specific meaning. It means a correction is coming, just as \u201cYes\u201d means a reward is coming.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I can show you how to teach your dog the behaviors you want and hold your dog accountable for those behaviors. <\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Were you really confused just now reading the title of this blog post?
